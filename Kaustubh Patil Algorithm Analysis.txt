What are the key concepts you learnt from these courses
You can choose one module from the list below:-
1)Algorithm Analysis
2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms
3)Dynamic Programming


Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Algorithm Analysis : 

Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the 
required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Analysis of algorithms is the determination 
of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.

Main learnings were its types which are Best Case , Worst Case , Average Case algorithms.

These algorithms help to predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer
Also it is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm. There are too many influencing factors
