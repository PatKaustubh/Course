What are the key concepts you learnt from these courses
You can choose one module from the list below:-
1)Algorithm Analysis
2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms
3)Dynamic Programming



Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

2) Divide and Conquer Algorithms

This technique has been divided into the following three parts:

a) Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
b) Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
c) Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
 
And the algorithms which fall under Divide and Conquer are:
1) Quick Sort 
2) Merge Sort
3) Closest Pair of Points
4) Starssen's Algorithm
5) Cooleyâ€“Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm
6) Karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication
